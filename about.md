Bienvenidos!

My name is Jake and I graduated from Kennesaw State University with a bachelors degree in Cyber Security. I am currently back in school at KSU pursuing a masters degree in IT. I am currently studying for the [AWS Certified Cloud Practioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) certification and will be looking to earn the [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) certification next.
